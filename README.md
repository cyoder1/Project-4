## Unsolved problems/ major hurdles
The main issue on this project was having time to complete all that I would have liked to. In the future I would like to expand the website to have another model containing user updates and milestones for their projects rather than having all updates on a large text area. This would help secure information and prevent a user from modifying information they may not want to at the time.
